## TODO

- add car movement with wasd to test collision
- add function to create distance map using sensor data
- maybe if not lazy use a good method to detect colision before ai abuses bugs
- add some form of semi-supervised learning ai to the car

## Important

- fix output issue not showing lines on other then first screen part
- fix probably wrong save data causing crashes when loading maps

## Done

- fix random max distance returns while programm is working otherwise correctly different outcomes even with no multithreading
- fix only max distance returns on some launches INFO somehow caused by graphics thread add mutexes should fix it
