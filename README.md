## TODO
 - fix only max distance returns on some launches
 - fix random max distance returns while programm is working otherwise correctly
 - add car movement with wasd to test collision
 - add function to create distance map using sensor data
 - maybe if not lazy use a good method to detect colision before ai abuses bugs
 - add some form of semi-supervised learning ai to the car
